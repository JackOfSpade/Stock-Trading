-- SCHEDULED QUERY (fix A3 + 2026-06-22 automation-health additions): the cadence / control-plane
-- dead-man's switch. Complements daily_freshness_check.sql (which catches a stale ENGINE / D2 data work).
-- This one catches the things that "ran or didn't" rather than "data is current":
--   * missed_run            — a MONITORED routine expected today logged no 'completed' run (state.cadence_watch)
--   * backup_stale          — the events.* GCS backup has gone silent (state.backup_health; 16_automation_health.sql)
--   * automation_heartbeat  — an out-of-band Apps Script (alert_emailer / weekly_report) went silent (state.automation_heartbeat)
--   * instruction_drift     — a routine's live web-UI trigger differs from the canonical catalog (state.instruction_drift; W2)
--
-- SELF-BOOTSTRAPPING (see bigquery/12 + 16): every signal here only fires once a routine/backup/script has
-- demonstrably started logging, so this never false-alarms on something not yet adopted.
--
-- RECORD-THEN-RAISE: every condition writes a durable, idempotent ops.alerts row FIRST (so no condition
-- masks another), then a SINGLE consolidated RAISE at the end fires BigQuery's built-in "Send email
-- notifications on failure" — an identity-independent channel that delivers even when the thing that
-- failed is the alert emailer itself. instruction_drift is a config bug to FIX, not a halt, so it records
-- a warning but does NOT contribute to the RAISE (matching the prior behaviour).
--
-- TIMING: BigQuery schedules are UTC. Run ~05:15 UTC (≈ 22:45 MDT / 21:45 MST) — same Denver evening,
-- after D2/D3, like the freshness check. APPLY ORDER: bigquery/16_automation_health.sql must be applied
-- BEFORE re-pasting this query (it references state.backup_health + state.automation_heartbeat). See
-- ops/RUNBOOK.md "Scheduled queries".
