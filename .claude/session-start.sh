# SessionStart hook — align the harness-assigned branch to latest origin/main.
#
# Companion to .github/workflows/auto-merge-claude.yml: routines push their
# assigned `claude/<suffix>` branch at session end, and the Action merges it
# into main server-side (and deletes the merged branch). To start each
# routine from the latest committed state, we hard-reset the assigned branch
# to origin/main here.
#
# We deliberately STAY on the harness-assigned branch (do NOT checkout main)
# so the harness's end-of-session push targets the assigned branch — the
# only push target the harness allows.
#
# Best-effort: never block session start on git failures.
