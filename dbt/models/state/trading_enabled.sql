-- Parallel-run dbt port of bigquery/47_trading_enabled_resync.sql:state.trading_enabled — canonical
-- source is that file until owner cutover. Originally added 2026-07-04 (audit finding, HIGH
-- severity) as a port of 23_trading_control.sql; updated 2026-07-14 to match 47's merge of 34's
-- trading_halted exclusion with 23's 2026-07-11 snapshot_stale term, after a parity audit found
-- this mirror had drifted from the live view for both fixes. The machine-readable gate:
-- sp_assert_trading_enabled reads this before every order-staging step.
