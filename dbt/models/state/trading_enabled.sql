-- Parallel-run dbt port of state.trading_enabled. CANONICAL SOURCE is
-- bigquery/97_halt_echo_dependency_gate.sql (which SUPERSEDES 78, which superseded 47, 34
-- and 23) until owner cutover. Originally added
-- 2026-07-04 (audit finding, HIGH severity) as a port of 23_trading_control.sql; updated 2026-07-14
-- to 47, then to 78's two changes (drawdown AND-term is breach_hard, not the -15% soft tier;
-- blocking_criticals excludes category IN ('trading_halted','staleness')), then 2026-07-19 to 97's
-- halt-echo missing_dependency exclusion (halt_echo_md below). The machine-readable gate:
-- sp_assert_trading_enabled reads this before every order-staging step.
--
-- DRIFT FIX 2026-07-18: this port carried 78's LOGIC but had kept 47's older snapshot_stale halt_reason
-- WORDING. Both sides currently return halt_reason = NULL (snapshot_stale is FALSE), so row-level parity
-- passed — but the moment that branch fired, dbt_parity.py would have reported real drift and failed CI
-- on a purely cosmetic string. The message below is byte-identical to the canonical file's.
-- Keep all SEVEN halt_reason strings in lockstep with 97 when either side changes.
