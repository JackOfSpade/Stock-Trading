-- Parallel-run dbt port of state.trading_enabled_mechanical. CANONICAL SOURCE is
-- bigquery/97_halt_echo_dependency_gate.sql (which SUPERSEDES 78, which superseded 34 and 33)
-- until owner cutover; 2026-07-19: 97's halt-echo missing_dependency exclusion (halt_echo_md
-- below) added — keep all halt_reason strings in lockstep with 97 when either side changes.
-- Added 2026-07-14 (audit finding, HIGH severity) as a port of bigquery/34 — this D2a-scoped
-- safety gate had ZERO dbt mirror despite its live sibling
-- state.trading_enabled having full coverage since 2026-07-04, so scripts/dbt_parity.py could never
-- catch drift on this gate. Deliberately excludes marks_fresh/engine_fresh (D2a's own same-run-
-- circular term — see bigquery/33_gate_ordering_fix.sql's header). ops.sp_assert_trading_enabled_
-- mechanical reads this before D2a's mechanical sweep/persist-and-wait re-craft step.
