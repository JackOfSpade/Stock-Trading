# Operations Runbook

Companion to the analysis fixes. **Repo artifacts and additive BigQuery objects are already
done.** This file lists the steps that need the GCP/GitHub **console** (which automation cannot
click) plus the staged adoptions. Each item says what it solves (P0–P3 from the analysis).

---

## 0. What is already live (no action needed)
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): runs the options-math self-test + `pytest` + the
  `strategy/` slice-drift check on every push/PR. *(P0-1, P2-3)*
- **BigQuery objects deployed & verified** (additive, idempotent):
  `bigquery/09_market_calendar.sql` → `events.market_holidays`, `state.market_calendar`,
  `state.trading_day_today`; `bigquery/10_observability.sql` → `ops.run_log`, `ops.alerts`,
  `ops.sp_log_run`, `ops.sp_raise_alert[_once]`, `state.freshness`, `state.system_health`,
  `state.gate_watch`; `bigquery/11_theater_judge.sql` → `analytics.theater_judge`,
  `ops.sp_score_theater`, `analytics.theater_check_calibration`.
- Quick check anytime: `SELECT * FROM state.system_health;` (want `all_green = TRUE`).

To re-apply or move to a fresh project, run `bigquery/01..11_*.sql` in order via the BigQuery MCP
`execute_sql` (same pattern the existing files use).

---

## 1. Scheduled queries — **the dead-man's switch** *(P0-2, P0-3)*
Until these exist, the procedures only run when a session calls them (a skipped session =
silent drift). Bodies are in `bigquery/scheduled_queries/` (see that folder's README).

BigQuery Studio → **Scheduled queries → Create**. **BigQuery schedules are UTC** (the UI's
local-time label is misleading) — use the UTC times below so the check lands in the Denver
evening *after* D2 year-round:
1. **Embeddings heal** — paste `embed_pending.sql`; daily ~06:00 UTC; Location US. (Timing is
   irrelevant — the embedder is idempotent.)
2. **Freshness check** — paste `daily_freshness_check.sql`; **daily at 05:00 UTC** (≈ 22:30 MDT /
   21:30 MST — evening, after D2; NOT 21:30 UTC, which is 15:30 MDT = *before* D2 and would
   false-alarm every trading day). Under **Notifications**, enable *Send email on failure* — the
   query RAISEs when `system_health` isn't green, so that email IS the alert (no Pub/Sub needed).
3. The new scheduling UI no longer exposes `maximum_bytes_billed`; don't worry about it — both
   queries scan < 2 MB. Cost is bounded by the budget alert in §2. *(P2-2)*

---

## 2. Cost guardrails *(P2-2)*
- GCP Console → **Billing → Budgets & alerts** → budget on project `stock-trading-498512`
  with email thresholds (Vertex embeddings/Gemini/AI.FORECAST are the only billed pieces;
  they're pennies, but unattended scheduled jobs should be capped).
- Prefer `execute_sql_readonly` for agent reads. (`maximum_bytes_billed` isn't settable on
  scheduled queries in the current UI; the scheduled scans are tiny, so the budget alert is the
  guardrail.)

---

## 3. Backups of the event store *(P2-1)*
`events.*` is now the irreplaceable source of truth; only 7-day time-travel protects it today.
Bucket + lifecycle are **DONE** (`gs://stock-trading-backups`, US, delete > 400 days). To automate
the actual backups with **no Cloud Run job and no key**, use the BigQuery scheduled query
`bigquery/scheduled_queries/backup_events_export.sql` (it `EXPORT DATA`s every `events.*` table to
the bucket as dated Parquet, straight from BigQuery):
1. Grant the scheduled query's service account `roles/storage.objectAdmin` on `gs://stock-trading-backups`.
2. Create the scheduled query: daily ~05:30 UTC (after the freshness check); Location US; no destination.
3. *(Alternative, ad-hoc / full export)* run `BUCKET=gs://stock-trading-backups scripts/backup_events.sh`
   from Cloud Shell — same Parquet layout, uses the `bq` CLI; good for a one-off verification.
4. (Optional, auditability) have D2 run `scripts/state_snapshot.sh` and commit
   `state_snapshots/` — restores the "git diff shows what changed today" property the
   `.md`→BigQuery cutover gave up, without resurrecting the retired live-state files.

---

## 4. Dashboard *(P1-4)*
Two options (pick one):
- **No console:** schedule `python ops/dashboard/generate_dashboard.py` (needs `bq` auth) and
  serve `ops/dashboard/index.html` via GitHub Pages / commit it. Self-contained HTML.
- **Looker Studio:** New report → BigQuery connector → `state.system_health`,
  `perf.strategy_daily`, `analytics.strategy_nav`, `ops.alerts`, `state.gate_watch`.

---

## 5. Make CI actually gate merges *(P0-1)* — DONE
`auto-merge-claude.yml` now triggers on the **CI** workflow's completion (`workflow_run`) instead
of on push, and merges a `claude/*` branch only if the CI run for that branch's **exact tip
commit** concluded `success`. A red build is skipped (and retried automatically when its CI later
turns green), so a broken commit no longer reaches `main` — all without human intervention or
changing the direct-push model. The `lint` job is `continue-on-error` (advisory), so it never
affects the gate. Fail-closed: in-progress / missing / API-error states are treated as "not green".
Considered but rejected: re-running the tests inside the merge job (duplicates CI and, in the
drain-all loop, would need a per-branch checkout+test), and branch protection + required checks
(would force PRs, abandoning the direct-push model).

## 6. Enable the CI SQL dry-run *(P2-3)* — optional, low priority
The `sql-validate` job dry-runs every `bigquery/*.sql` on each push **only if** a `GCP_SA_KEY`
secret is present; without it the job skips cleanly (CI stays green). **Recommended: leave it
skipped.** A downloadable SA JSON key is exactly the long-lived credential this project
deliberately removed (`bigquery/README.md`: "the bq-loader service-account key was deleted"), and
SQL is already dry-run via the BigQuery MCP during development. If you do want CI to validate SQL,
prefer **keyless GitHub→GCP Workload Identity Federation** (no downloadable key) over a JSON
secret — then point the `sql-validate` job at the WIF auth action.

---

## 7. Adopt `run_log` + `alerts` in the routines *(P1-1, P0-4)* — DONE
Now a **global convention** in `Claude_Task_Plan.md` ("## Observability — run logging & failure
alerts") that binds every routine (D1–A3 + the adversarial attacker/orchestrator), with D2 as the
worked example (its `RUN LOGGING` step + the §13 cash-tripwire alert in `Claude_Task_Plan.md` and
`Operating_Protocols.md §13.A.4`). No per-routine action remains. For reference, the two calls
each routine makes (see also `ops/cadence.yaml` `defaults`):
- **Start/end of every routine:** `CALL ops.sp_log_run('<id>', <run_date>, 'started'|'completed'|'failed'|'halted', <session>, <branch>, <rows>, <error>, <note>)`.
  This populates `state.freshness.d2_ran_last_trading_day` and the audit trail.
- **On any hard-stop** (cash tripwire > $1, dual-path max-loss disagreement, embedding
  unhealthy, merge-conflict PR, stale data): `CALL ops.sp_raise_alert('critical', '<routine>',
  '<category>', '<message>', '<payload_json>')` **and** create a `[Claude] ATTENTION …`
  calendar event so the unmonitored failure reaches the operator.

## 8. Extend the market-holiday calendar yearly *(P1-3)*
Each December, append next year's NYSE/Nasdaq full closes (+ any early closes) to
`events.market_holidays` (MERGE in `bigquery/09_market_calendar.sql` is the template) and extend
the date range in `state.market_calendar` if needed.

## 9. Strategy slices — staged cutover *(P3-1)*
`strategy/*.md` are generated from `Strategy.md` (parallel-run; nothing reads them yet). When
ready, re-point routine read-instructions in `Claude_Task_Plan.md` / `Operating_Protocols.md` at
the per-strategy slice (+ preamble/router) so blinding becomes a file boundary and context shrinks.
Regenerate after any `Strategy.md` edit: `python scripts/split_strategy.py` (CI guards drift).

## 10. Theater judge — run it *(P3-2)*
Add to **W5**: `CALL ops.sp_score_theater();` then read `analytics.theater_check_calibration`
to compare the objective judge against the orchestrator's self-certified theater_check. Billed
(Gemini) but tiny — only scores not-yet-scored paired reviews.

## 11. Conviction gate watch *(P3-3)*
No action now (B at 5/30, D at 0/30 closed). `state.gate_watch` surfaces proximity; revisit the
gated conviction model (`bigquery/04_analytics.sql`) when `approaching_gate` flips TRUE.

## 12. Public-exposure guardrail — enforce `iam.disablePublicIamGrants` *(security, deferred)*
From the 2026-06-19 public-exposure audit. IAM is clean today (no `allUsers` /
`allAuthenticatedUsers` on the project or any BigQuery dataset, GCS bucket has Public Access
Prevention enforced), but nothing *prevents* a future accidental public grant. The
`iam.disablePublicIamGrants` org-policy constraint rejects any such binding outright — turning
"clean today" into "can't be made public by accident."

**Not actionable yet:** the constraint can only target a resource under a **Google Cloud
Organization**, and `stock-trading-498512` is a standalone project with no Org (the Org Policies
page returns "select a resource under an organization"). When/if you attach the project to an Org
(requires Google Workspace or Cloud Identity + domain verification — owner-only setup):
1. IAM & Admin → **Organization Policies** → constraint **`iam.disablePublicIamGrants`** ("Disable
   public IAM grants") → set **Enforced** at the org or project level.
   CLI: `gcloud resource-manager org-policies enable-enforce iam.disablePublicIamGrants --project=stock-trading-498512`
   (only succeeds once the project is under an Org where the constraint is available).
2. Related, optional: enforce `iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains` (Domain restricted sharing) to
   confine bindings to your own domain.
